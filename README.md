## List of Questions

#### 1 [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

* If a number is odd, the next transform is 3*n+1
* If a number is even, the next transform is n/2
* The number is finally transformed into 1. 
* The step is how many transforms needed for a number turned into 1. 

Given an integer n, output the max steps of transform number in [1, n] into 1.

#### 2 [Implement Queue with Limited Size of Array](https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/queue/array/types.html)

Implement a queue with a number of arrays, in which each array has fixed size.

[Java Source Code](https://github.com/dqi2018/airbnb/blob/master/src/main/java/implement_queue_with_fixed_size_of_arrays/ImplementQueuewithFixedSizeofArrays.java)

#### 3 List of List Iterator

Given an array of arrays, implement an iterator class to allow the client to traverse
and remove elements in the array list.

This iterator should provide three public class member functions:

* boolean hasNext() return true if there is another element in the set
* int next() return the value of the next element in the array
* void remove() remove the last element returned by the iterator. That is, remove the element that the previous next() returned. This method can be called only once per call to next(), otherwise an exception will be thrown.

#### 4 Display Page (Pagination)

Given an array of CSV strings representing search results, output results sorted by a score initially. A given host may have several listings that show up in these results. Suppose we want to show 12 results per page, but we don’t want the same host to dominate the results. 

Write a function that will reorder the list so that a host shows up at most once on a page if possible, but otherwise preserves the ordering. Your program should return the new array and print out the results in blocks representing the pages. 

Given an array of csv strings, output results separated by a blank line.

#### 5 Travel Buddy

I have a wish list of cities that I want to visit to, my friends also have city wish lists that they want to visit to. If one of my friends share more than 50% (over his city count in his wish list), he is my buddy.

Given a list of city wish list, output buddy list sorting by similarity.

#### 6 File System

Write a file system class, which has two functions: create, and get 
* create("/a",1) 
* get("/a") //get 1
* create("/a/b",2) 
* get("/a/b") //get 2 
* create("/c/d",1) //Error, because "/c" is not existed 
* get("/c") //Error, because "/c" is not existed

#### 7 [Palindrome Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/description/)

#### 10 [CSV Parser](http://creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm#EmbedBRs)

Write a method to parse input string in CSV format.

[Java Source Code](https://github.com/dqi2018/airbnb/blob/master/src/main/java/csv_parser/CSVParser.java)

#### 11 [Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/description/)

 Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words. 

#### 12 Regular Expression

Implement a simple regex parser which, given a string and a pattern, returns a boolean indicating whether the input matches the pattern.

By simple, we mean that the regex can only contain special character: 

* \* (star) The star means what you'd expect, that there will be zero or more of previous character in that place in the pattern.
* . (dot) The dot means any character for that position. 
* \+ (plus). The plus means one or more of previous character in that place in the pattern.

#### 13 Water Drop/Water Land/Pour Water

Input is a array represent how the height of water is at each position, the number of water will be poured, and the pour position.
Print the land after all water are poured.

Example:
input land height int[]{5,4,2,1,3,2,2,1,0,1,4,3}
The land is looks ike:

```text
+
++        +
++  +     ++
+++ +++   ++
++++++++ +++
++++++++++++
012345678901
```

water quantity is 8 and pour at position 5. The land becomes:

```text
+
++        +
++www+    ++
+++w+++www++
++++++++w+++
++++++++++++
012345678901
```
